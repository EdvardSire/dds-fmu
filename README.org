* Development

  You will need [[https://conan.io/][conan 2]]. The compiler profile should specify =compiler.cppstd=17=. There
  are conan packages not available in =conancenter=, you will need to build them yourself.
  They are available as recipes, which are located in [[https://gitlab.sintef.no/seaops/equipment][seaops/equipment]] under
  tools/recipes, and [[https://gitlab.sintef.no/cppfmu/cppfmu][cppfmu/cppfmu]]. The following packages should be built: =cppfmu=,
  =fmilibrary= (to appear on CCI), =fmu-compliance-checker=, =xtypes=.

  #+begin_src bash
    cd dds-fmu
    conan install . -u -b missing -o dds-fmu/*:with_doc=True -c tools.build:skip_test=False
    conan build . -o dds-fmu/*:with_doc=True -c tools.build:skip_test=False
  #+end_src

  The created FMU is located in =build/Release/fmus/= on Linux.

* Known issues

  + Executable permission for =repacker= tool is lost with the bundled zip tool
    + On Linux, the user will need to use =chmod= on the =repacker= tool.
  + There is no support for building multi-configuration in the same build folder
    (e.g. debug and release with Microsoft Visual Compiler)
  + Several complex types are not yet supported
    + *Unsupported*: sequence (=std::vector=), map, and union
  + =@key= /IDL annotations/ are not fully supported
    + *Supported*: primitive types, =string= and =Enumeration=
    + *Unsupported*: structs, arrays
