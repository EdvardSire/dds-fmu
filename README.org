* Development

  You will need [[https://conan.io/][conan 2]]. The compiler profile should specify =compiler.cppstd=17=. There
  are conan packages not available in =conancenter=, you will need to build them yourself.
  They are available as recipes, which are located in [[https://gitlab.sintef.no/seaops/equipment][seaops/equipment]] under
  tools/recipes, and [[https://gitlab.sintef.no/cppfmu/cppfmu][cppfmu/cppfmu]]. The following packages should be built: =cppfmu=,
  =fmilibrary= (to appear on CCI), =fmu-compliance-checker=, =xtypes=.

  #+begin_src bash
    cd dds-fmu
    conan install . -u -b missing -o dds-fmu/*:with_doc=True -c tools.build:skip_test=False
    conan build . -o dds-fmu/*:with_doc=True -c tools.build:skip_test=False
  #+end_src

  The created FMU is located in =build/Release/fmus/= on Linux.

* Implementation tasks and known issues

  + Executable permission for =repacker= tool is lost with the bundled zip tool
  + There is no support for building multi-configuration in the same build folder (e.g. debug and release)
  + Sequence types (e.g. =std::vector=) and other complex types are not supported

  + [ ] Add proper support for multi-config builds
  + [ ] Fix zipping tool with executable permissions
    - Perhaps a clue found here: [[https://github.com/kuba--/zip/blob/f8e112927646a44674cfa57ff44ab59c7cf4fa41/src/zip.c#L1396][permissions in kuba zip function used]].
  + [ ] Add support for sequences and other variable size containers and missing types.
    + Would benefit from some annotation indicating max length
    + Figure out which types are not supported
    + Wait until FMI 3 with binary support
